#### Context
In the preliminary stages of the Freedom Project, I started tinkering with my new tool: Swift. It is a compiled programming languaged developed by Apple that aids with IOS development, specifically to create apps. This year, I had chose to make a brain stimulating app that will include various activities to actively engage the mind of users. I had partnered up with Kyle once again for this project.

#### Choosing a Tool
With a wide selection of tools to choose from, I had to check many documentations and watch videos, and I was able to trim the options down and focus on two: Swift and GoDot. To figure out which tool was right for me, I started a tinkering process.

For Swift, I started off tinkering by reading how to install the tool by referring to a [documentation](https://www.swift.org/install/macos/) provided by the developers. I downloaded VS Code, and shortly, I created a new project folder on my laptop that would store everything I do. Afterwards, I ran my first terminal commands: `mkdir myCLI`, `cd myCLI`, and `swift package init --name MyCLI --type executable`. This allowed me to create a directory and enter it and then install the swift package with the `main` folder.

As I finished setting up my codespace, I started creating my first variables and conditionals, using a Swift tutorial Youtube [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J239BhLvOCA) as a tool to guide me along the way. First, I declared a new boolean variable by using the `let` keyword and then establishing the data type along with setting it to the appropriate value: `let firstItemOne: Bool = true`. Next, I created a new string variable D `let helloWorld = "Hello World"`. The last variable I declared was a new data type: `Date`. I named my variable `myDate` and set it equal to `Date()`, which returned the most recent time whenever I ran the code in the terminal. At last, I created a conditional statement. To do so, I first created a boolean variable num and set it equal to true. After that, I created an `if` statement where `if num == true { print("num is true!") }`. Using `swift run MyCLI`, I was able to get the output of all of the code I wrote.


As for GoDot, I took a preview at its [website](https://godotengine.org/) and looked over the [documentation] and previews that was provided. Immediately, I found the tool to be less of a fit for my agenda. The tool itself was used for more visual games that required many files for sprites, backgrounds, and plug-ins. As for my game, I plan for it to be simplistic, yet still visually appealing, and purposeful. In addition, I visited a [GoDot Playground](https://godotplayground.com/new), where I observed some code such as `Button.new()` and `obj = MeshInstance3D.new()`.


Because Swift allows me to build an app that I envision, I decided to stick with the tool for the year. Swift is also a readable language and adding to the fact that it provides explanations to syntax errors, it was the right tool for me. GoDot was over what was necessary.


#### EDP
As of right now, I am on the first stage of the Engineering Design Process: Define a Problem. An issue that I wish to solve with Kyle is to improve brain functions against factors such as old-age or social media addiction. To tackle this problem effectively, I would need to do more research on my tool and work well with Kyle to create a prototype.

#### Time Management
Out of many tools, I had to quickly figure out which one I would resort to for the year. For many of the tools, I clicked on various links that led me to documentations or previews. But in order to save time, I mainly observed whether or not the tools would suffice my idea. This helped me to narrow down my list to just Swift and GoDot.


#### Organization
As I searched for a tool to use for the year, I conducted many tinkering processes. When I started to mess around with the tools, I saved many tutorial links and documentations as bookmarks so I could refer back to them easily. This not only saved me time but improve the overall efficiency of my tool seleciton process.
