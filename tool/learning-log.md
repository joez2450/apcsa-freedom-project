# Tool Learning Log

## Tool: **Swift**

## Project: **Brain Stimulating IOS App**

### 9/30/25:
* I looked over the [Swift documentation](https://www.swift.org/documentation/) for 15 minutes to try and get a gist of the tool

* I downloaded VS Code and installed a Swift extension to import all of its features.
    * I used watched this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J239BhLvOCA) to serve as a reference point during the installation process.
    * I created a new folder in File Explorer and imported it into VS Code.
* I created my first text using the `print` statement:

    ``` Swift
    print("Hi, my name is Joe")
    ```
* I also declared a variable, name, using `var` and assigned it a value of "Joe". Afterward, I created a `print` statement:

    ``` Swift
    var name = "Joe"
    print(name)
    ```
Note: Semicolons are optional in Swift. However, it drastically improves readability, which is beneficial when you have to debug your code.

* At last, I changed the value of my original variable by using the `=` constructor to reassign its value:

    ``` Swift
    var name = "Joe"
    print(name)
    name = "Hi World"
    ```
